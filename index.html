      The primary reason why do we sleep – is to recover from the days’ stress
      on the body, to repair muscle damage, and to freshen up to the next
      days’ demands. On the other hand, as paradoxical as it may seem, our
      mind buzz of activity while we are asleep, even more than when we are
      awake.
    </h3>

    <h2>But why the brain is so active during the sleep?</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        💤 We are experienced a lot during the day – our brain is too busy
        taking in everything we see, hear and feel, hence during the sleep our
        mind categorize and store all of this information. To increase
        performance on certain mental tasks – sleep is good but dreaming while
        sleeping – is better, and it means we dream to remember.
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        💤 However, we also dream to forget. Mainly during R.E.M. sleep cycles,
        our neocortex reviews these neural connections and dumps the unnecessary
        ones. This "reverse learning" is very important for our mind because
        useless connections and parasitic thoughts could disrupt the necessary
        thinking.
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        💤 We always dream but we not always remember. In our brain remains only
        a small fraction of what we actually dreamed. In exception, if we happen
        to wake up suddenly while we are in the R.E.M. phase of sleep, we are
        often able to remember quite a lot of our dream’s content.

        💤 John Steinbeck once wrote that a problem difficult at night is
        resolved in the morning after the “committee of sleep” has worked on it.
        Unconstrained by reality and the rules of conventional logic, in our
        dream, we can create limitless scenarios to help solve a problem. It has
        been proved by numerous scientific discoveries, that changed the world.
        Among them, Mendeleev’s periodic table, the structure of the benzene
        molecule detected by August Kekule, James Watson’s envision of DNA
        double helix, Larry Page’s idea with the <span class="g">G</span><span class="oe">o</span><span
          class="o">o</span><span class="g">g</span><span class="l">l</span><span class="oe">e</span>. That’s why there
        is an idiom “sleep on it”.
      </div>      
      <div class="col">
        💤 It is highly important for the body to be relaxed during sleep. If a
        body is disturbed by some external or internal sensations, a
        subconscious will be affected by this. Anything like that will either
        bring a person out of a dream state, or influence on the dreams he has.
        Specialists recommend, if you experience unpleasant dreams, try to pay
        more attention to taking care of yourself and to deal with circumstances
        that are causing you stress.

      Even after a great deal of scientific research, technological
      advancement, and persistence, we still don’t have any definite answers.
      Thus, there is still so much to learn about the mind and the dreams,
      making it one of the most fascinating and intriguing scientific fields.
