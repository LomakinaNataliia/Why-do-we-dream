        The primary reason why do we sleep ‚Äì is to recover from the days‚Äô stress
        on the body, to repair muscle damage, and to freshen up to the next
        days‚Äô demands. On the other hand, as paradoxical as it may seem, our
        mind buzz of activity while we are asleep, even more than when we are
        awake.

      <h2 id="read">But why the brain is so active during the sleep?</h2>

      <div class="main-content">
        <div class="theses">
          We are experienced a lot during the day ‚Äì our brain is too busy taking
          in everything we see, hear and feel, hence during the sleep our mind
          categorize and store all of this information. To increase performance
          on certain mental tasks ‚Äì sleep is good but dreaming while sleeping ‚Äì
          is better, and it means we dream to remember.
        </div>
        <div class="theses">
          However, we also dream to forget. Mainly during R.E.M. sleep cycles,
          our neocortex reviews these neural connections and dumps the
          unnecessary ones. This "reverse learning" is very important for our
          mind because useless connections and parasitic thoughts could disrupt
          the necessary thinking.
        </div>
        <div class="theses">
          We always dream but we not always remember. In our brain remains only
          a small fraction of what we actually dreamed. In exception, if we
          happen to wake up suddenly while we are in the R.E.M. phase of sleep,
          we are often able to remember quite a lot of our dream‚Äôs content.

          John Steinbeck once wrote that a problem difficult at night is
          resolved in the morning after the ‚Äúcommittee of sleep‚Äù has worked on
          it. Unconstrained by reality and the rules of conventional logic, in
          our dream, we can create limitless scenarios to help solve a problem.
          It has been proved by numerous scientific discoveries, that changed
          the world. Among them, Mendeleev‚Äôs periodic table, the structure of
          the benzene molecule detected by August Kekule, James Watson‚Äôs
          envision of DNA double helix, Larry Page‚Äôs idea with the
          <span class="g">G</span><span class="oe">o</span
          ><span class="o">o</span><span class="g">g</span
          ><span class="l">l</span><span class="oe">e</span>. That‚Äôs why there
          is an idiom ‚Äúsleep on it‚Äù.

        <div class="theses" style="max-width: 400px">
          It is highly important for the body to be relaxed during sleep. If a
          body is disturbed by some external or internal sensations, a
          subconscious will be affected by this. Anything like that will either
          bring a person out of a dream state, or influence on the dreams he
          has. Specialists recommend, if you experience unpleasant dreams, try
          to pay more attention to taking care of yourself and to deal with
          circumstances that are causing you stress.

        Even after a great deal of scientific research, technological
        advancement, and persistence, we still don‚Äôt have any definite answers.
        Thus, there is still so much to learn about the mind and the dreams,
        making it one of the most fascinating and intriguing scientific fields.
