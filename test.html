          If you routinely lose sleep or choose to sleep less than needed, the
          sleep loss adds up. The total sleep lost is called your sleep debt.
          For example, if you lose 2 hours of sleep each night, you'll have a
          sleep debt of 14 hours after a week.

          Getting enough quality sleep at the right times helps you function
          well throughout the day.

        🌞
        <p>
          As the sun rises, your body releases cortisol. This hormone naturally
          prepares your body to wake up, hence sleeping when your body is ready
          to sleep is very important. <br />
          For example, light signals received through your eyes tell a special
          area in your brain that it is daytime. This area of your brain helps
          align your body clock with periods of the day and night.
        </p>
        🌚
        <p>
          When it gets dark, your body releases a hormone called melatonin.
          Melatonin signals to your body that it's time to prepare for sleep,
          and it helps you feel drowsy.
        </p>
        ⌚
        <p>
          Sleep deprivation can affect people even when they sleep the total
          number of hours recommended for their age group. For example, people
          whose sleep is out of sync with their body clocks (such as shift
          workers) or routinely interrupted (such as caregivers or emergency
          responders) might need to pay special attention to their sleep needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your job or daily routine limits your ability to get enough sleep
          or sleep at the right times, talk with your doctor. You also should
          talk with your doctor if you sleep more than 8 hours a night, but
          don't feel well-rested. You may have a sleep disorder or other health
          problem.

          Sleep deprivation might lead to sleep deficiency that alters activity
          in some parts of the brain. If you are sleep deficient, you may have
          trouble making decisions, solving problems, controlling your emotions
          and behavior, and coping with change. Sleep deficiency also has been
          linked to depression, suicide, and risk-taking behavior. <br />

          provides a good example. Interns on a traditional schedule with
          extended work hours of more than 24 hours made 36% more serious
          medical errors than interns on a schedule that allowed more sleep.

          On the other hand, good sleep has been shown to improve
          problem-solving skills and enhance the memory performance of both
          children and adults. You can check more details in the relevant
          articles on the PubMed.gov (

          Studies show that a good night's sleep improves learning. Whether
          you're learning math, how to play the piano, how to perfect your golf
          swing, or how to drive a car, sleep helps enhance your learning and
          problem-solving skills. Sleep also helps you pay attention, make
          decisions, and be creative.

          A lack of sleep may affect a person’s desire or ability to maintain a
          healthful lifestyle, but it may or may not be a direct contributor to
          weight gain. For example,
          <a

          gain and obesity in both children and adults.

          Some people nap as a way to deal with sleepiness. Naps may provide a
          short-term boost in alertness and performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, napping doesn't provide all of the other benefits of
          night-time sleep. Thus, you can't make up for lost sleep. Napping in
          preschool-aged children is normal and promotes healthy growth and
          development.
        </p>
        📅
        <p>
          Some people sleep more on their days off than on workdays. They also
          may go to bed later and get up later on days off. Sleeping more on
          days off might be a sign that you aren't getting enough sleep.
          Although extra sleep on days off might help you feel better, it can
          upset your body's “sleep–wake rhythm”.

          Bad sleep habits and long-term sleep loss will affect your health. If
          you're worried about whether you're getting enough sleep, try using a
          sleep diary for a couple of weeks. Write down how much you sleep each
          night, how alert and rested you feel in the morning, and how sleepy
          you feel during the day. Show the results to your doctor and talk
          about how you can improve your sleep. You can find a sample sleep
          diary in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's

        <h1>To improve your sleep habits, it also may help to:</h1>

        <h3>
          💤 Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. For children,
          have a set bedtime and a bedtime routine. Don't use the child's
          bedroom for timeouts or punishment. <br />
          💤 Try to keep the same sleep schedule on weeknights and weekends.
          Limit the difference to no more than about an hour. Staying up late
          and sleeping in late on weekends can disrupt your body clock's
          sleep–wake rhythm. <br />
          💤 Use the hour before bed for quiet time. Avoid strenuous exercise
          and bright artificial light, such as from a TV or computer screen. The
          light may signal the brain that it's time to be awake. <br />
          💤 Avoid heavy and/or large meals within a couple of hours of bedtime.
          (Having a light snack is okay.) Also, avoid alcoholic drinks before
          bed. <br />
          💤 Avoid nicotine (for example, cigarettes) and caffeine (including
          caffeinated soda, coffee, tea, and chocolate). Nicotine and caffeine
          are stimulants, and both substances can interfere with sleep. The
          effects of caffeine can last as long as 8 hours. So, a cup of coffee
          in the late afternoon can make it hard for you to fall asleep at
          night. <br />
          💤 Spend time outside every day (when possible) and be physically
          active. <br />
          💤 Keep your bedroom quiet, cool, and dark (a dim night light is fine
          if needed).<br />
          💤 Take a hot bath or use relaxation techniques before bed. <br />
